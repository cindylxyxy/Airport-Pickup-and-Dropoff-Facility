# PickupDropoffFacility

This directory contains the Python codes which implement the study on pickup and dropoff facility design, with a focus on the throughput capacity comparison of such facilities at airports. A detailed description of the simulation modeling as well as a thorugh discussion on the findings and the impacts are summarized in a paper, which can be accessed at
