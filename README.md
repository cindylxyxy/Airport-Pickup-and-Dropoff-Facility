# Airport Pickup Dropoff Facility Design and Throughput Capacity Evaluation

This directory contains the Python codes which implement the study on pickup and dropoff facility design, with a focus on the throughput capacity comparison of such facilities at airports. The 'Code_updated_20210531' folder contains the most updated version, while the 'Code' folder is outdated. You may find instructions to run the experiments under each sub-directories. A detailed description of the simulation modeling as well as a thorugh discussion on the findings and the impacts are summarized in a paper, which can be accessed at
